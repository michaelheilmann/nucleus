A command is split into an array of strings named arguments.
Argument 0 is (normally) the command name, argument 1, the first element following the command, and so on.

- An "option" is a documented type of argument modifying the behaviour of a command e.g. "-v" or "--verbose" are options.

- A "parameter" is an argument that provides information to either the command or one of its options, e.g. in "-o file", "file" is the parameter of the "-o" option.
